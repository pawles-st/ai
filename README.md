# Artificial Intelligence

This course was dedicated to learning basic methods of artificial intelligence.

List 1 - Effective searching through the state space with A* algorithm to solve the 15 puzzle.\
List 2 - Implmenting an intelligent bot that plays a variation of tic-tac-toe: placing a 4 pattern results in an immediate loss.\
List 3 - Learning neural networks in Python with Tensorflow, as well as implmenting own gradient descent algorithm.\
List 4 - Decision trees and DBScan.
